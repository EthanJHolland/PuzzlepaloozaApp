# PuzzlepaloozaApp
Project from summer 2016. Android app with a firebase backend designed for a puzzle competition such as Puzzlepalooza (http://puzzlepalooza.mbhs.edu/) at Montgomery Blair High School. Begun at HackUMBC. Finished but never published and no longer maintained due to the Firebase SDK changes when Google bought Firebase. Put on github for archival purposes.
